# Identified Bugs 
1. After Entering The Correct OTP, We Get Redirected To The Login Page.. Then If We Again Comeback to The OTP Submission Page, And Again Submit The OTP, Another Account With The Same User Credentials is Created.

2. When We Navigate to Edit Product, The Image Of The Product Doesn't Comes With The Other Form Data.

I am Working On These Bugs & Trying to Fix Them As Early As Possible
